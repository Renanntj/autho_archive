# autho_archive

autho_archive is a Python-based automation tool designed to enforce file system organization, eliminate duplication, and improve operational efficiency in Linux environments.

This project was built with a simple premise: disorganized file structures silently degrade productivity, increase cognitive load, and introduce unnecessary operational noise. Instead of treating this as a minor inconvenience, autho_archive approaches it as a structural engineering problem.
